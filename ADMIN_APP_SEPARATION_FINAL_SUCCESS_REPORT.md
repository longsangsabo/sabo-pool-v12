## 🎯 **NEXT PHASE RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Phase 3: Component Migration** (Week 4)
Now that the foundation is solid, the next phase should focus on:

1. **Admin Component Migration**
   - Move existing admin pages from `src/pages/admin/` to `apps/sabo-admin/src/pages/`
   - Migrate admin components from `src/components/admin/` to `apps/sabo-admin/src/components/`
   - Update all imports and dependencies

2. **User Feature Migration**  
   - Move user-facing pages to `apps/sabo-user/src/pages/`
   - Migrate public components to `apps/sabo-user/src/components/`
   - Implement user authentication flow

3. **Original Codebase Deprecation**
   - Gradually remove components from original `src/` directory
   - Update all references to use new app structure
   - Remove redundant files and dependencies

### **Success Criteria for Phase 3**
- [ ] All admin functionality moved to admin app
- [ ] All user functionality moved to user app  
- [ ] Original `src/` directory can be safely removed
- [ ] Both apps pass comprehensive testing
