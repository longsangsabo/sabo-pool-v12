3. **Third-party Integration:** Chart libraries, external components
4. **Advanced Patterns:** Complex responsive behaviors

### Recommendation: **DEFERRED**
- These represent legitimate dynamic styling needs
- ROI on conversion would be minimal
- Business features should take priority
- Current 90%+ adoption is excellent achievement
