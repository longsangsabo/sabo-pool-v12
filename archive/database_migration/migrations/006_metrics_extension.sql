-- DEPRECATED FILE (006_metrics_extension.sql)
-- This migration has been superseded by 006_advanced_validation.sql which
-- redefines log_migration and adds performance / validation features.
-- Intentionally left without executable statements so re-application is a NO-OP.
-- Kept only because automated deletion in this environment did not succeed.
-- Safe to ignore or remove manually outside automated tooling.
