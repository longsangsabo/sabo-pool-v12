## 8. 💻 Code Examples & Patterns

### **Tournament Creation Pattern**
```typescript
// From UnifiedTournamentContext.tsx
const createTournament = async (tournamentData: TournamentFormData) => {
  const tournamentDataForDB = {
    name: tournamentData.name,
    description: tournamentData.description,
    club_id: tournamentData.club_id,
    max_participants: tournamentData.max_participants,
    entry_fee: tournamentData.entry_fee,
    prize_pool: tournamentData.prize_pool,
    // ... additional configuration
    status: 'upcoming',
  };

  const { data: result, error } = await supabase
    .from('tournaments')
    .insert(tournamentDataForDB)
    .select()
    .single();
    
  if (error) throw error;
  return result;
};
```

### **VNPAY Payment Integration Pattern**
```javascript
// From vnpay-payment-gateway.js
const createVNPAYHash = (params, secretKey) => {
  const sortedParams = Object.keys(params)
    .sort()
    .reduce((result, key) => {
      result[key] = params[key];
      return result;
    }, {});

  const queryString = Object.keys(sortedParams)
    .map(key => `${key}=${sortedParams[key]}`)
    .join('&');

  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha512', secretKey);
  hmac.update(queryString);
  return hmac.digest('hex');
};
```

### **Performance Monitoring Pattern**
```typescript
// From performance-monitor.ts
class PerformanceMonitor {
  trackCustomMetric(name: string, value: number, unit: string = 'ms') {
    const metric: PerformanceMetric = {
      name: `custom_${name}`,
      value,
      rating: this.getRating(name, value),
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      url: window.location.href,
    };
    this.recordMetric(metric);
  }
}
```

## 9. 📈 Performance & Optimization

### **Current Performance Monitoring**
```typescript
// Performance metrics tracked:
- Load time measurement
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Bundle size monitoring
- API response time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Component render time tracking
```

### **Optimization Implementations**
- **Debouncing:** Search inputs and form submissions
- **Memoization:** Expensive calculations cached with TTL
- **Performance Observer:** Web Vitals tracking implemented
- **Memory Monitoring:** Heap size tracking in development
- **Custom Metrics:** Tournament-specific performance tracking

### **Performance Issues Identified**
- Large component count (378 components) without code splitting
- No apparent lazy loading implementation
- Bundle optimization needs improvement
- Database query optimization required for complex tournament queries

## 10. 📱 Mobile Readiness Assessment

### **Current Mobile Status: ⚠️ Limited**

**Responsive Design:**
- Tailwind CSS responsive classes implemented
- Basic mobile viewport configuration present
- Component responsive behavior varies by component

**Mobile-Specific Issues:**
- No React Native mobile application found
- Touch interface optimization incomplete
- Mobile payment flow needs testing
- Performance on mobile devices not optimized

**Mobile Development Recommendations:**
- Implement comprehensive responsive design audit
- Add touch-friendly component interactions
- Optimize bundle size for mobile networks
- Consider Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation
- Test payment flow extensively on mobile devices

**Missing Mobile Features:**
- Native mobile application
- Offline functionality
- Push notifications for mobile
- Mobile-optimized tournament bracket display
- Touch gestures for interactive elements
