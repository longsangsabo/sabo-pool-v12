## 🏗️ New Architecture

### **Before → After**
```
❌ BEFORE: Monolithic Chaos
└── Single massive codebase
    ├── Mixed admin/user code
    ├── 1,246 files in src/
    ├── 494 loose scripts
    └── Unclear structure

✅ AFTER: Clean Monorepo
├── apps/sabo-user/       # User Platform (Port 8080)
├── apps/sabo-admin/      # Admin Interface (Port 8081)
├── packages/shared-*/    # Reusable libraries
├── docs/                 # Organized documentation
└── archive/              # Legacy code preserved
```
