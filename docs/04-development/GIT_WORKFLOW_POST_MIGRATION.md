## 🚀 PUSH STRATEGY

### Safe Push Process
```bash
# 1. Verify everything works locally
pnpm dev  # Should start without errors
pnpm build  # Should build successfully

# 2. Check remote status
git status
git log --oneline -5  # Review recent commits

# 3. Push to main branch
git push origin main

# 4. Verify deployment (if auto-deploy is setup)
# Check Netlify/Vercel dashboard for successful deployment
```

### If Push Conflicts
```bash
# Pull latest changes first
git pull origin main

# Resolve any conflicts
# Re-test everything
pnpm dev
pnpm build

# Push again
git push origin main
```

## 📊 POST-PUSH VERIFICATION

### Deployment Checks
```bash
# Monitor build process
# Check deployment logs
# Verify live site functionality

# If using Netlify:
# - Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
# - Verify site loads correctly
# - Test key functionality

# If using Vercel:
# - Check deployment status in Vercel dashboard  
# - Verify preview deployment works
# - Test production deployment
```

### Quality Monitoring
```bash
# Set up monitoring
pnpm design-system:check

# Verify metrics:
# - Inline styles: ≤60 files ✅
# - Hex colors: ≤12 files ✅  
# - Shared components: ≥55 ✅
# - Overall health: HEALTHY ✅
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### ✅ Ready to Push When:
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] All apps load correctly in browser
- [ ] Typography components render properly
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] `pnpm design-system:check` shows healthy status

## 🚨 ROLLBACK PLAN (If Needed)

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# If push causes major issues:
git log --oneline -10  # Find last good commit
git revert [commit-hash]  # Revert problematic commit
git push origin main  # Push the revert
