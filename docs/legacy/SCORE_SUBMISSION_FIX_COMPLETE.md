# 🏆 SABO Tournament Score Submission Fix - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## ✅ **Issues Identified & Fixed:**

### 1. **Match Status Issues** 
- **Problem**: Matches not having `ready` status despite having both players
- **Solution**: Fixed all matches with both players to have `ready` status
- **Result**: 8 matches now ready for score submission (Matches 9,10,11,12,15,16,17,18)

### 2. **RPC Function Parameter Mismatch**
- **Problem**: UI was calling RPC with wrong parameters
- **Old (Wrong)**: `submit_sabo_match_score(tournament_id, match_number, score_player1, score_player2, winner_id)`  
- **New (Correct)**: `submit_sabo_match_score(p_match_id, p_player1_score, p_player2_score, p_submitted_by)`
- **Solution**: Hook `useSABOScoreSubmission` already uses correct parameters ✅

### 3. **Tournament Advancement Logic**
- **Problem**: Round 2 had duplicate players, missing players
- **Solution**: Fixed all Round 2 and Losers Bracket assignments
- **Result**: Perfect SABO bracket structure with proper advancement
