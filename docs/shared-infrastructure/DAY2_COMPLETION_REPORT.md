## 🎯 Completed Tasks

### ✅ shared-types Optimization (4h)
- **Consolidated type definitions**: Unified duplicate User, Tournament, and other core types
- **Removed type conflicts**: Fixed duplicate UserRole definitions
- **Enhanced type exports**: Improved index.ts with comprehensive re-exports
- **Optimized type structure**: Better organized user.ts, game.ts, and common.ts
- **Added comprehensive types**: Enhanced UserRole, AuthState, and Profile types

### ✅ shared-auth Cleanup (2h)
- **Improved environment handling**: Better cross-platform env variable access
- **Enhanced AuthService class**: Added role management methods
- **Optimized auth hooks**: Improved AuthProvider with better error handling
- **Added admin auth support**: Extended hooks for admin-specific operations
- **Fixed type safety**: Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors

### ✅ Integration Testing (2h)
- **Package build verification**: All 5 shared packages building successfully
- **Type checking passed**: No TypeScript errors across packages
- **Admin app compatibility**: Verified admin app still works with changes
- **Cross-package dependencies**: Validated shared package interdependencies
